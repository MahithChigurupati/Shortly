## Project Overview

Shortly is a URL shortener application designed to develop server-side logic for shortening URLs, handle databases, and ensure high performance and responsiveness to requests from the front-end.

## Features

A URL shortener is a service used by users to shorten long, hard-to-remember URLs into easy-to-share shortened redirects. 

In this project, I have implemented the following features:

1. An endpoint that takes a long URL and returns a shortened URL with a random short ending.
2. An endpoint that returns a history of all URLs shortened by a given user.
3. Short URLs actually redirect to their corresponding long URLs.
4. Implemented tier-based request limits. For example, Tier 1 users can make up to 1000 requests, while Tier 2 users can make only 100 requests.
5. Allowing users to optionally create their preferred custom URLs.
